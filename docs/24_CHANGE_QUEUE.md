# 24 — Pizza Avenue Change Queue

> **Purpose:** Chronological operational history of all meaningful changes in the Pizza Avenue codebase.
> **Rule:** Every meaningful feature, fix, refactor, migration, deployment, incident, rollback, documentation update, or architecture decision must be recorded here.

This file is not a replacement for Git history, GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, `17_CHANGELOG.md`, or `16_DECISIONS.md`.

It is the **human-readable execution queue** that makes it easy to understand:

- what changed,
- why it changed,
- where it changed,
- who changed it,
- what is pending,
- what must be tested,
- whether it reached staging,
- whether it reached production,
- whether follow-up work remains.

---

# 1. Queue Rules

Every meaningful task creates one queue item.

Each queue item gets a unique ID:

```text
CHG-0001
CHG-0002
CHG-0003
```

Never reuse an ID.

Do not delete completed queue items.

If a change is reverted:
- keep original entry,
- add a new rollback/revert entry,
- link both.

---

# 2. Allowed Status Values

Use only:

```text
PLANNED
IN_PROGRESS
IN_REVIEW
STAGING
BLOCKED
READY_FOR_RELEASE
PRODUCTION
ROLLED_BACK
CANCELLED
```

---

# 3. Change Types

Use one:

```text
FEATURE
FIX
HOTFIX
REFACTOR
DATABASE
API
UX
SECURITY
INFRA
DEPLOYMENT
DOCUMENTATION
DECISION
TEST
ROLLBACK
```

A change may list more than one if needed.

---

# 4. Priority

Use:

```text
P0 — Production critical
P1 — High priority
P2 — Normal
P3 — Low priority
```

---

# 5. Queue Summary

Keep this section updated.

```text
Next Change ID: CHG-0004

Open:
3

In Progress:
1

Blocked:
0

Ready for Release:
0

Production:
0
```

---

# 6. Active Queue

> Keep only non-final items here.

Final statuses are:
- PRODUCTION
- ROLLED_BACK
- CANCELLED

When an item reaches a final state, move it to **Completed History** below.

## CHG-0001 — Publish governed documentation baseline to GitHub

- **Status:** IN_REVIEW
- **Type:** DOCUMENTATION, INFRA
- **Priority:** P1
- **Owner:** Codex / Priyansu
- **Created:** 2026-10-05
- **Last Updated:** 2026-10-05

### Business Reason

Establish the authoritative Pizza Avenue documentation in the empty GitHub repository and make the documented branch, review and change-queue workflow enforceable for every later coding task.

### Requested Outcome

The complete documentation baseline is safely published without secrets; `main` and `develop` exist for production/staging workflow; the actual baseline is proposed from a short-lived documentation branch; future agents can discover and must follow documents 21–25.

### Scope

Included:
- verify the destination remote is empty,
- add a repository-safe `.gitignore`,
- connect `AGENTS.md`, README and the master index to governance docs 21–25,
- document the one-time empty-repository bootstrap exception,
- initialize Git and publish the documentation baseline,
- create GitHub Issue/PR where available.

Excluded:
- application/prototype code,
- GitHub branch-protection or account settings,
- staging or production deployment,
- product/business-rule changes.

### GitHub Tracking

Issue:
- #1

Branch:
- `docs/repository-bootstrap`

Pull Request:
- #3 — merged into `develop`; no staging deployment was performed
- #2 — merged into `main` before the prescribed `develop` review path; recorded as a workflow deviation, not a deployment

### Affected Surfaces

- Documentation
- Repository workflow
- Infrastructure governance

### Affected Modules

- None; no application modules exist or change.

### Files / Areas Changed

- `.gitignore`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/17_CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/20_MASTER_INDEX.md`
- `docs/22_GIT_GITHUB_WORKFLOW_RULES.md`
- `docs/23_CODING_AGENT_PROMPTING_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/24_CHANGE_QUEUE.md`
- initial Git metadata and remote branch publication

### Database Impact

Migration required:
- No

Data migration required:
- No

### API Impact

New endpoints:
- None

Changed endpoints:
- None

Breaking change:
- No

### State Machine Impact

- None

### Permission Impact

- No application permission change. GitHub repository settings are intentionally not modified.

### Analytics Impact

- None

### Environment / Secret Impact

New env vars:
- None

Changed env vars:
- None

`.gitignore` prevents local environment files, private keys, logs, database dumps and backups from being committed.

### Documentation Updated

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/17_CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/20_MASTER_INDEX.md`
- `docs/22_GIT_GITHUB_WORKFLOW_RULES.md`
- `docs/23_CODING_AGENT_PROMPTING_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/24_CHANGE_QUEUE.md`

### Tests Required

- [x] Markdown structure/required-reference validation
- [x] Secret-name and staged-content scan
- [x] Git branch/remotes/status verification
- [x] Remote refs verification after push
- [x] GitHub Issue/PR verification where available
- [ ] Staging — not applicable/not deployed
- [ ] Production smoke test — not applicable/not deployed

### Edge Cases

- Empty remote has no base branch for the first PR.
- Initial branch seeding must not be misreported as staging or production deployment.
- Later work must not reuse the bootstrap exception.
- No local secret or backup artifact may enter the initial commit.
- A separate PR from the bootstrap branch was merged into `main` while the governed `develop` PR remained open.

### Security Review

- Auth implications: Git transport uses the developer's configured credential helper; credentials are not printed or committed.
- RBAC implications: none in the application; repository settings remain owner-controlled.
- Secret/PII implications: scan staged files and exclude environment/private-key/database-backup artifacts.
- Replay/idempotency implications: pushes are non-force and remote refs are verified before and after.

### Staging Result

Status:
- Not Tested — no staging deployment performed

### Production Result

Status:
- Not Released — a documentation merge exists on `main`, but no production deployment or smoke-test evidence exists

Release:
- Not Released

Deployment date:
- Not applicable

### Known Risks

- The empty remote requires one exceptional branch-seeding operation before PR targets exist.
- Branch protection and required approvals remain owner-managed GitHub settings and are not changed by this task.
- The governed Pull Request #3 remains unmerged until peer review and validation are complete.
- Pull Request #2 bypassed the documented `develop`-first release flow by merging the baseline into `main`; this must not be treated as staging or production deployment.

### Follow-Up

- [x] Record the actual Pull Request reference: #3.
- [ ] Obtain peer review before merging the baseline PR.
- [ ] Decide whether Pull Request #2's premature `main` merge should be retained as a documented bootstrap exception or reverted through a new reviewed PR.

### Final Result

In review. Governance consistency work and staged-content security checks passed. The empty remote was seeded with identical bootstrap refs for `main` and `develop`, and the complete documentation baseline was pushed to `docs/repository-bootstrap`. GitHub Issue #1 records the work, and Pull Request #3 is open against `develop` for peer review. Pull Request #2 was separately merged into `main` by `gitg2k3` before the required `develop` review flow completed; no attempt was made to hide, overwrite or revert that event. No staging or production deployment occurred.

## CHG-0002 — Frontend Stage 1 Architecture Foundation

- **Status:** STAGING
- **Type:** FEATURE, REFACTOR, DOCUMENTATION
- **Priority:** P1
- **Owner:** Codex / Priyansu
- **Created:** 2026-10-05
- **Last Updated:** 2026-10-06

### Business Reason

Create a production-shaped frontend operating foundation so Customer, KDS and Admin work can proceed in parallel and later replace mocked HTTP responses with the frozen NestJS `/api/v1` backend without rewriting route or feature architecture.

### Requested Outcome

A buildable, type-safe, route-complete, mock-powered and testable pnpm workspace using React 19, Vite, TypeScript, React Router, TanStack Query, Zustand, React Hook Form, Zod, MSW, Vitest and React Testing Library. The result must remain visually neutral and contain no backend, database, provider or real-auth implementation.

### Scope

Included:
- create `apps/customer`, `apps/kds` and `apps/admin`,
- create shared `types`, `api-client`, `mocks`, `utils` and neutral `ui` packages,
- define documented domain/state contracts and integer-paise `Money`,
- model documented `/api/v1` HTTP contracts through a typed API client,
- provide realistic seed fixtures, factories and programmatically switchable mock scenarios,
- configure TanStack Query for server state and Zustand only for transient prototype state,
- provide React Hook Form/Zod schema foundations,
- add representative architecture tests, workspace lint/typecheck/test/build commands and CI validation,
- document developer commands, the paise contract decision and actual verification results.

Excluded:
- polished or high-fidelity UI,
- final brand/design tokens or component styling,
- NestJS services/controllers, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Redis or BullMQ,
- real OTP, WhatsApp, payment, session or WebSocket integration,
- marketplace/delivery features,
- deployment and GitHub repository settings.

### GitHub Tracking

Issue:
- #4

Branch:
- `feature/frontend-stage-1-foundation`

Pull Request:
- #6 — open against `develop`

### Affected Surfaces

- Customer PWA foundation
- Kitchen/KDS foundation
- Founder/Admin foundation
- Shared frontend packages

### Affected Modules

- `apps/customer`
- `apps/kds`
- `apps/admin`
- `packages/types`
- `packages/api-client`
- `packages/mocks`
- `packages/utils`
- `packages/ui`

### Files / Areas Changed

- root pnpm, TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, environment and CI configuration
- `apps/customer` route/feature/query/form/scenario foundation
- `apps/kds` route/query foundation
- `apps/admin` route/query foundation
- `packages/types` shared domain contracts
- `packages/api-client` typed HTTP modules and error normalization
- `packages/mocks` MSW handlers, realistic fixtures, factories and scenarios
- `packages/utils` query keys, integer-paise money helpers and order-transition validation
- `packages/ui` neutral structural primitives only
- generated MSW browser workers for the three applications

### Database Impact

Migration required:
- No

Data migration required:
- No

### API Impact

New backend endpoints:
- None

Frontend contract impact:
- typed client functions and MSW handlers mirror the existing frozen `/api/v1` contracts

Breaking change:
- No production API exists or changes in this stage

### State Machine Impact

- No production state transitions are implemented.
- Shared types use the documented order, payment, pickup, reward and store values.
- A pure test helper validates the documented order transition graph and rejects illegal shortcuts.

### Permission Impact

- No real authentication or authorization is implemented.
- KDS/Admin route shells do not grant access; future protected APIs remain server-authoritative.

### Analytics Impact

- Shared event names/types mirror `12_ANALYTICS_EVENTS.md` for contract readiness.
- No analytics provider or authoritative financial reporting is implemented.

### Environment / Secret Impact

New placeholder variables:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- `VITE_APP_ENV`
- `VITE_ENABLE_MOCKS`

Changed secrets:
- None

### Documentation Updated

- `README.md`
- `docs/16_DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/17_CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/24_CHANGE_QUEUE.md`

### Tests Required

- [x] Workspace lint
- [x] Workspace typecheck
- [x] Unit/component tests — 27 passed
- [x] App boot tests — Customer, KDS and Admin
- [x] Customer route resolution tests
- [x] Mocked menu API-client test
- [x] TanStack Query rendering test
- [x] Payment-failure scenario test
- [x] Pickup-full scenario test
- [x] Valid and invalid order-state transition tests
- [x] Customer/KDS/Admin production builds
- [x] Local dev-server HTTP smoke checks — ports 5173, 5174 and 5175 returned HTTP 200
- [ ] Staging — not performed in this task
- [ ] Production smoke test — not performed in this task

### Edge Cases

- page and feature modules must not import mock fixtures directly,
- mocks must use documented HTTP contracts rather than simplified prompt examples,
- provisional client prices must never appear authoritative,
- future order-source values must not create marketplace integrations,
- invalid mock order-state transitions must be rejected,
- scenario changes must remain deterministic between tests,
- MSW must be disabled safely when a real backend is introduced.

### Security Review

- Auth implications: modeled states only; no real OTP, magic token, cookie or credential storage.
- RBAC implications: route placeholders are not authorization; protected APIs remain future server responsibilities.
- Secret/PII implications: only fictional data and empty environment placeholders; no real phone, OTP, token or provider payload.
- Replay/idempotency implications: contracts expose idempotency boundaries, but no provider processing is implemented.

### Staging Result

Status:
- Not Tested — merged into `develop` through PR #6 on 2026-10-06; no staging environment or deployment evidence is available.

### Production Result

Status:
- Not Released

Release:
- Not Released

Deployment date:
- Not applicable

### Known Risks

- Menu names/prices are realistic documentation fixtures, not founder-approved production menu truth.
- MSW validates frontend architecture only and cannot prove future backend enforcement, transactions, idempotency or permissions.
- Stage 1 intentionally leaves visual design and high-fidelity interaction decisions open.
- Browser MSW is development-only and is removed from the live data path by setting `VITE_ENABLE_MOCKS=false` when a backend is available.

### Follow-Up

- [x] Merge Pull Request #6 into `develop` after required CI passed.
- [ ] Deploy and validate staging when that environment exists.
- [ ] Define the design system and implement the high-fidelity Customer PWA in the next task only.

### Final Result

Merged into `develop` through PR #6 at `fef19a37c1e080fb46e2722b2b00b2bbf7ecec67`. The three applications boot, all requested routes resolve, frontend modules consume typed HTTP contracts through TanStack Query and the shared API client, and MSW provides realistic fixtures/scenarios without page-level data coupling. Lint, typecheck, 27 tests, three production builds and local HTTP smoke checks passed before merge. No backend, database, provider, real authentication, deployment or final design system was created. No staging or production deployment occurred.

## CHG-0003 — Domain Routing Freeze — Root Landing + App Subdomains

- **Status:** IN_REVIEW
- **Type:** INFRA, REFACTOR, DOCUMENTATION, DECISION
- **Priority:** P1
- **Owner:** Codex / Priyansu
- **Created:** 2026-10-06
- **Last Updated:** 2026-10-06

### Business Reason

Separate the public marketing surface from customer and operational applications so the root domain can serve landing/SEO needs while Customer, KDS, Admin and API have clear deployment, security and routing boundaries.

### Requested Outcome

Reserve `pizzaavenue.<domain>` for a minimal landing surface; move Customer, KDS, Admin and API to `app`, `kds`, `admin` and `api` subdomains respectively; remove redundant KDS/Admin internal path namespaces; and document future cookie, CORS, QR/magic-link, DNS and SPA-routing behavior.

### Scope

Included:
- minimal Landing application shell and local-development configuration,
- shared environment-derived surface/API URL configuration,
- KDS/Admin root-relative routing and route-test updates,
- per-app environment examples and local port documentation,
- deployment/domain, CORS, cookie, DNS, magic-link and SPA fallback documentation.

Excluded:
- final landing-page design or content,
- backend, session, CORS, DNS, Cloudflare, Docker or Caddy deployment implementation,
- real WhatsApp, payment or authentication integration,
- staging or production deployment.

### GitHub Tracking

Issue:
- #7 — Domain Routing Freeze — Root Landing + App Subdomains

Branch:
- `feature/domain-routing-freeze` (stacked on the unmerged Stage 1 frontend foundation)

Pull Request:
- #8 — open against `feature/frontend-stage-1-foundation` (stacked on PR #6)

### Affected Surfaces

- Landing
- Customer PWA
- Kitchen/KDS
- Founder/Admin
- Infrastructure documentation

### Affected Modules

- `apps/landing`
- `apps/customer`
- `apps/kds`
- `apps/admin`
- `packages/config`
- deployment and routing documentation

### Files / Areas Changed

- `apps/landing` minimal React/Vite architecture shell and local environment example.
- `apps/customer`, `apps/kds` and `apps/admin` environment examples, URL bootstrap configuration and Vite port configuration.
- KDS and Admin React Router paths/tests.
- `packages/config` shared public surface/API URL resolver.
- `compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile.frontend`, `.dockerignore` and `infra/caddy`/`infra/docker` deployment configuration for existing frontend services.
- root workspace scripts, lockfile and local-environment guidance.
- `README.md`, `docs/04_USER_FLOWS.md`, `docs/05_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/10_API_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/15_BUILD_PLAN.md`, `docs/16_DECISIONS.md`, `docs/17_CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/21_DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` and this queue entry.

### Database Impact

Migration required:
- No

Data migration required:
- No

### API Impact

New endpoints:
- None

Changed endpoints:
- None; frontend API base configuration remains `/api/v1`-compatible.

Breaking change:
- No production API exists. KDS/Admin browser route prefixes change before public launch.

### State Machine Impact

- None.

### Permission Impact

- No permission implementation change. Documentation will preserve future cookie-session, CSRF and credentialed CORS requirements.

### Analytics Impact

- None in this routing shell. Landing acquisition instrumentation remains future work.

### Environment / Secret Impact

New public, non-secret Vite configuration may include:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- `VITE_LANDING_URL`
- `VITE_CUSTOMER_APP_URL`
- `VITE_KDS_URL`
- `VITE_ADMIN_URL`

### Documentation Updated

- `README.md`
- `docs/04_USER_FLOWS.md`
- `docs/05_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/10_API_CONTRACTS.md`
- `docs/15_BUILD_PLAN.md`
- `docs/16_DECISIONS.md` (DEC-024)
- `docs/17_CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/21_DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/24_CHANGE_QUEUE.md`

### Tests Required

- [x] Unit/component route tests — Landing CTA and root-relative KDS/Admin route matching; 37 tests pass in 6 files.
- [x] Workspace lint — passed with zero warnings.
- [x] Workspace typecheck — passed across all 11 workspace projects.
- [x] Workspace test suite — 6 files, 37 tests passed.
- [x] Workspace production builds — Landing, Customer, KDS and Admin passed.
- [x] Manual local route smoke checks — HTTP 200 for Landing `/`; Customer `/`, `/menu`, `/cart`, `/orders/example`; KDS `/`, `/orders`; Admin `/`, `/menu`.
- [x] Docker Compose configuration — `docker compose --env-file infra/docker/.env.example config` passed.
- [ ] Docker image build — not run because Docker Desktop's Linux daemon is unavailable on this machine.
- [x] GitHub Actions `frontend-foundation` for PR #8 — passed.
- [ ] Staging — not deployed
- [ ] Production smoke test — not released

### Edge Cases

- Direct SPA navigation/reload for nested Customer, KDS and Admin routes.
- MSW must intercept the configured cross-origin or same-origin `/api/v1` API base.
- Future credentialed API calls must not rely on wildcard CORS.
- QR/WhatsApp magic links must target Customer, never the marketing root domain.

### Security Review

- Auth implications: no session is implemented; document the intended parent-domain, `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` model for a future backend.
- RBAC implications: none; route relocation is not authorization.
- Secret/PII implications: Vite files contain public URLs only, never session or provider secrets.
- Replay/idempotency implications: none.

### Staging Result

Status:
- Not Tested — no staging environment is configured or deployed

### Production Result

Status:
- Not Released

Release:
- Not Released

Deployment date:
- Not applicable

### Known Risks

- This branch is intentionally stacked on unmerged PR #6; it must be rebased or retargeted after that foundation merges.
- API, worker, PostgreSQL and Redis are intentionally absent from the current Compose file until their real runtimes exist.
- Docker Desktop's Linux daemon is currently unavailable, so image construction and Caddy runtime validation remain pending.

### Follow-Up

- [x] Create GitHub Issue #7.
- [x] Push branch and open stacked Pull Request #8 against `feature/frontend-stage-1-foundation`.
- [ ] Retarget/rebase PR #8 to `develop` after PR #6 merges; do not merge PR #6 without the required human authorization and review.
- [ ] Build and run the frontend Compose stack on a host with Docker's Linux daemon, then validate Caddy routes and TLS.
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare DNS, TLS Full (strict), secrets and credentialed CORS only during infrastructure rollout.

### Final Result

Implementation complete locally and awaiting an Issue/PR/review. The root domain is reserved by a neutral Landing shell; Customer, KDS and Admin receive dedicated local ports and production/staging URL configuration; KDS/Admin no longer include their subdomain namespaces in browser routes. Compose/Caddy configuration is present for the existing static frontend services, while API/backend runtime services remain intentionally absent. No DNS, Cloudflare, staging or production action occurred.

Do not create an entry for:

- typo only,
- formatting only,
- comment cleanup,
- trivial non-functional rename,

unless it is part of a larger tracked change.

---

# 10. Queue Update Timing

Update the queue:

## Before coding
Create or confirm entry.

Set:

```text
Status: IN_PROGRESS
```

## PR opened

Set:

```text
Status: IN_REVIEW
```

Add PR number.

## Merged to develop / deployed to staging

Set:

```text
Status: STAGING
```

Record staging result.

## Staging approved

Set:

```text
Status: READY_FOR_RELEASE
```

## Production released

Set:

```text
Status: PRODUCTION
```

Record:
- release tag,
- deployment date,
- smoke-test result.

## Rollback

Do not edit old history to pretend it never happened.

Set original item as appropriate and create:

```text
Type: ROLLBACK
```

new entry linked to original.

# 12. Naming Convention

Titles should describe outcome.

Good:

```text
CHG-0041 — Add WhatsApp magic login
CHG-0042 — Prevent duplicate payment confirmation
CHG-0043 — Add pickup slot capacity locking
CHG-0044 — Harden KDS reconnect recovery
```

Bad:

```text
CHG-0041 — Update
CHG-0042 — Changes
CHG-0043 — Fix issue
```

---

# 13. Production Incident Linking

For a production incident:

```text
CHG-0101 — Fix duplicate order on payment replay
```

Then link:

```text
Related Incident:
INC-0003
```

If no incident file exists yet, record the issue/PR references here.

---

# 14. Developer Handoff Rule

Before handing a task to the other developer, update:

- current status,
- what is complete,
- what is not complete,
- branch,
- blockers,
- test status,
- next step.

The receiving developer should be able to continue by reading the queue entry plus linked issue/PR.

---

# 15. Agent Handoff Rule

Every coding agent must read this file before changing code.

The agent must:

1. Find whether a queue item already exists.
2. Reuse it if the task is the same.
3. Create a new queue item if the work is distinct.
4. Update the item before implementation.
5. Update it after implementation.
6. Update it after tests.
7. Update it after staging/production if the agent performs those actions.

The agent must not create duplicate entries for the same task.

Why
↓
Issue
↓
Queue Entry
↓
Branch
↓
Code
↓
Tests
↓
PR
↓
Staging
↓
Production
↓

```
